Easily add an ajax-enhanced login widget to your WordPress site sidebar.

== Description ==

Sidebar-Login adds a useful login widget which you can use to login from in the sidebar of your WordPress powered blog.

Once a user logs in it then redirects them back to the page they logged in from rather than the admin panel (this is configurable).

= Usage =

Simply go to `Appearance > Widgets` and drag "sidebar login" to the sidebar of your choice. Within the widget are several options you can use for changing the titles or the links displayed to the user.
